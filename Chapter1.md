### **Shadows of the Tribe**

I was born under a red sky, the one they said was a warning. From the moment I opened my eyes, the village insisted I carry a weight I did not understand. Some said the color of the clouds on my birth foretold storms, others whispered that I was marked by spirits the world had long forgotten. I do not know if they were right. I only know that I learned early to carry fear like a second skin.

Every morning, I watched the smoke from the village chimneys curl into the cold air and wondered if it would reach the mountains. I imagined what it would feel like to climb to the summit where no fire could follow. But I never went. Not then. Not ever. Curiosity was dangerous. Curiosity was what made children vanish into the forest, or so the elders said. And I, small and quiet, had learned the art of watching and waiting, of keeping my thoughts to myself.

We lived in a nation woven with superstition. Each family kept charms over their doors, carved with eyes that were supposed to see the unseen. The elders spoke endlessly of curses ,  of creatures that roamed the wilds, of spirits that punished those who strayed too far from hearth and heart. They were careful to teach fear. Fear was survival. And in the world of my childhood, it was the only truth you could cling to.

I remember the day it rained red moss across the northern hills. It was a rare phenomenon, but everyone in the village screamed that it was a sign. Mothers pressed their children close; the elders shook their heads and spat on the ground. The air was thick with incense and smoke, and I hid behind my mother’s skirts, trembling. No one saw me, really ,  or maybe they saw, and it didn’t matter. I learned, even then, that to be small was safer than to be bold.

I often wondered about the woods that bordered our fields. The trees were dark, dense, and whispered in ways the villagers insisted were dangerous. When the wind passed through them, it sounded like voices: laughter, crying, warning. I wanted to go, to follow those voices and see where they led. But I never did. Every day, the fear inside me stretched and lengthened, wrapping itself around my curiosity, and I obeyed. I became my own jailer.

At school, or whatever semblance of learning our village allowed, the children were taught obedience first. History was stories of wrathful spirits, of beasts and curses. There were no maps of the mountains beyond our ridge, no books to explain the world outside. Only warnings. “Stay within the fields,” the elders said. “Do not stray, for the earth remembers the trespasser.”

I obeyed. I memorized every lesson, every warning, every tale meant to keep children like me small and frightened. But knowledge is a trickster. Even as I repeated the warnings aloud in the circle of my peers, my mind wandered. I traced the edges of the forest in my imagination. I traced the river to the cliffs where no one walked. I wondered what it was like to touch stone that the village never touched, to smell water that flowed from a place untouched by human hands.

Fear was constant. It sat with me at meals, it hummed beneath the quilt at night, it clung to my hair like morning dew. I wanted to shake it off, to run, to breathe air untainted by superstition. But every glance from the elders reminded me: the world would punish the curious. And so I learned to measure my heartbeats, to count the steps of my own shadow, to keep my imagination quietly in check.

There were moments, fleeting, when I felt different. When the children laughed and the elders lectured, I would watch from the shadows and feel that sharp, alien sense of otherness. I was not like them. I did not fear in the same way, did not accept the weight of superstition with the same ease. I envied the bold ones who could run through the woods without hesitation, whose laughter rose without trembling. I envied them for a freedom I had never known.

Yet even then, I understood my place. I was not meant to step beyond the boundary of our fields, not meant to challenge the stories that had kept the village alive for generations. My mind rebelled in secret, but my body obeyed. Every whispered desire to run to the mountains, to touch the river where the elders warned no one should, was folded carefully into my chest and buried under layers of compliance. I was an outcast in my own skin, alone with thoughts I dared never speak aloud.

The mid-summer celebrations were the hardest. Everyone danced around the fire, flames licking at the dark sky. The smell of roasted grain, the tang of the river carried on warm wind, the beat of drums that could almost make you forget everything ,  all of it pressed in on me, and I felt both captivated and terrified. I wanted to join, to throw myself into the rhythm, to feel the fire lick my skin, to taste the smoke and sing with the rest. But I could not. I could not risk standing out. I could not risk drawing the eye of the elders, whose glances were sharp enough to burn.

I remember sitting apart, pressed against the roots of a gnarled tree, knees drawn up, eyes wide. The children shouted, spinning sticks and playing with the sparks. One of them, a boy named Rian, waved a branch near the fire and caught a spark on his sleeve. He laughed, a sound so raw and reckless that I wanted to join in. But I stayed frozen, caught between awe and terror.

It was then that I first noticed the tales of tails. The elders spoke of beasts in the mountains ,  dragons, they said, with tails that could crush a man’s house, claws that could rend a field in half, eyes that pierced the soul. I remember staring at the shadows cast by the fire, imagining the flickering light tracing the curve of a dragon’s tail. I felt my pulse jump, fear and fascination entwined. It was the first time I realized how vividly my mind could imagine something it had never seen.

That fascination frightened me. The tales of tails, of beasts, should have made me recoil. But I was enraptured. I traced the shadow of a dancing stick across the dirt and imagined it as a dragon’s tail sweeping the earth. I imagined its scales shining in firelight, immense wings folding and unfolding, eyes glinting like stars. And a part of me whispered: *If such creatures exist, they are not the monsters they say.*

I chastised myself immediately. The fear ingrained in me surged back. *You are just a foolish girl,* I told myself. *These are stories. Never wander. Never trust your imagination.* I pressed my hands to my lap, trying to still them, but the visions persisted. That night, I lay awake beneath my quilt, staring at the cracks where the moonlight fell, imagining the curve of a dragon’s tail disappearing into shadowed mountains.

The elders’ fear had been woven into me like thread in a tapestry. Every instinct screamed that dragons were deadly. Every lesson told me curiosity would be my ruin. And yet… I could not help it. Something inside me, small and desperate, resisted. It pulled me toward the edge of the forest, toward the cliff where the wind sang against stone.

By the end of that summer, I had begun to measure my life in silences. I learned how to walk the village streets without being noticed, how to smile when the elders spoke of spirits, how to pretend that the tales had convinced me, when inside, they had only deepened the hunger. I wanted to explore. I wanted to touch. I wanted to know the truth.

But I could not.

The weight of superstition was a cage I could not break. And so I lived within it, quietly, secretly, afraid of what I might become if I dared to step beyond its bounds. Afraid of shame. Afraid of exile. Afraid of whatever terror truly waited in the mountains. Afraid… yet fascinated, every waking moment, by the fire in the woods and the possibility of something beyond the stories.

And that is where I began, on the edge of fear and curiosity, the child of superstition, the girl who could not yet touch the sky ,  yet who dreamed of it endlessly.

My name is Rae and this is my story.


### **Rituals and Shadows**

The village rituals were both awe-inspiring and terrifying. They said the fires drove away spirits, that the drums summoned protection, that the smoke carried prayers into the heavens. I attended every ceremony, standing at the edge of the crowd, my small hands folded, my chest tight with the twin forces of fear and fascination.

The elders moved with deliberate solemnity, their chants rolling over the village like thunder, commanding obedience in every breath. Their voices, deep and unwavering, carried warnings of curses for those who disobeyed. “The mountains are not for you,” they would say, their eyes flicking over the crowd, sharp as blades. “The beasts watch. The winds remember. Do not stray.”

I believed them, most of the time. I wanted to. It was easier to fear than to risk imagining. But sometimes, when the firelight danced on the folds of their robes, I thought I glimpsed something else ,  a hesitation, a flicker of doubt ,  in their otherwise absolute certainty.

It was during the spring festival that my first rebellion of thought took root. The elders had set the circle, a ring of stones scorched black from centuries of fire, and began their incantations. I knelt at the back, eyes lowered, listening to the rhythms of the drums and the smoke curling into the night. I could feel the fear crawling along my spine, settling like ice in my chest.

And yet, as I watched, my gaze drifted beyond the circle. Beyond the crowd. Beyond the lights and the dancing shadows. The forest edge seemed to pulse under the moonlight, alive and waiting. Something about the dark there called to me, coaxed me with a whisper I could barely hear.

I shivered and looked down, scolding myself. *You are not meant to see. You are not meant to wonder. Stay within the circle. Obey.*

But the temptation refused to fade. When the elders’ voices rose in song, I imagined myself stepping past the stone ring, moving into the woods where no one dared. I pictured the trees parting for me, the river bending to my feet. I imagined the cliff edge, the wind ripping past, the world falling away ,  and my heart pounded, not with fear, but with yearning.

That night, I lay in my bed beneath the quilt, and I could still see the circle of fire. The smell of smoke clung to my hair, the sound of drums echoed in my ears. I traced the shapes of the mountains beyond the village, feeling the pull in my chest. I had been trained to fear the unknown, yet I could not resist it.

It was not defiance yet. It was longing. And longing, I realized, was dangerous.

By the following week, I had begun small acts of rebellion. I wandered a few steps further than I should along the riverbank, hiding in the reeds when anyone passed. I listened to the wind as it rustled through the trees, imagining it carrying voices that the elders had forbidden. I traced animal tracks, following them beyond the fields, until I lost myself in the scents and shadows of the forest.

Fear accompanied me like a shadow. Every snap of a twig, every rustle of leaves, set my pulse racing. I would freeze, heart hammering, listening for the footsteps of the villagers who would surely come for me. And yet, I could not stop. Every step, every breath, every secret touch of moss or bark, pulled me further from the safe, fearful world of the village.

It was during one of these excursions that I first saw the signs ,  enormous footprints pressed into the soil, deep and wide, clawed edges that no human could leave. My chest froze, terror squeezing my lungs. I wanted to run, to scream, to retreat into the safety of the village, and yet something compelled me to follow.

I remember crouching in the underbrush, tracing the shape of the track with my fingers. The earth smelled of wet stone and something else ,  something ancient. My mind screamed at me: *Go back! You will be cursed. You will die. You will bring ruin!*

And yet, I could not.

I told myself it was a trick of the forest, a fallen tree or an animal I had never seen. But deep inside, I knew better. My imagination, long a cage of fear, had begun to open doors I did not understand. And with those doors came questions ,  forbidden, dangerous questions.

Questions about the elders, about the stories, about the beasts they claimed to fear. What if the dragons, if they existed, were not the monsters of legend? What if the fear had been passed down so many generations that no one remembered why they were afraid at all?

The guilt was immediate and suffocating. I remembered the faces of the villagers, the sharp glances of the elders, the warnings pressed into me since childhood. *You are not safe. You are not safe. You will bring ruin.*

Yet the pull of curiosity persisted.

Over the next months, I became adept at hiding my thoughts. I learned to speak the words the elders expected while my mind wandered elsewhere, tracing the edges of the mountains, the bends of the river, the shadows that the firelight never touched. I learned to move quietly, so that no one could suspect the secret longings that drove me. I became my own observer, my own jailer, and my own accomplice.

I began to notice small patterns in the village that others seemed blind to. The way the elders’ eyes flickered at certain winds. The way the children’s whispers carried meanings they were too young to understand. The way the smoke from the chimneys shifted, telling stories I had been forbidden to read.

I began keeping a private journal, pressed into the hollow of a tree near the river, recording every observation, every anomaly. I wrote about the tracks I found, the strange cries in the forest at night, the shapes of clouds that moved like living creatures. Each word was a rebellion, each entry a small act of courage, though fear never left me.

And always, in the deepest corner of my mind, there was the pull ,  that impossible longing for something beyond the rules and warnings, something vast and alive. Something that the elders feared and I secretly admired.

At times, I imagined it. I imagined the curve of a tail, the glint of scales in moonlight, the brush of enormous wings against the night wind. I chastised myself immediately, recalling the stories, the warnings, the punishments. *You are foolish. You are nothing. You are doomed if you chase this.*

And yet, even as I told myself this, my heart leapt with the possibility.

Fear and fascination became inseparable companions. I did not yet know the creature that would call me, the heat and weight that would awaken me to the sky. I did not yet know the moments when terror would become wonder, and wonder would become flight.

But I was ready, even if I did not realize it.

Every whispered warning, every shadowed glance, every night spent alone in the forest, had been training. Not in obedience, but in attentiveness. Not in fear, but in patience. And all of it had built the foundations of what was to come ,  the edge of courage, the spark of curiosity, and the quiet, desperate yearning for something that might finally answer the questions no one dared to ask.

And that is where I stood, balancing between fear and longing, on the precipice of a world no one in the village could comprehend.




### **Edge of the Unknown**

The nights grew longer as summer waned. The air carried the chill of mountains distant and hidden, and every shadow seemed heavier than the last. I moved through the village with the practiced silence of someone who feared being noticed, yet my mind wandered always to the forest beyond the fields, to the mountains whose peaks were shrouded in mist and legend.

I had begun to speak less in the gatherings. The elders’ eyes followed me too closely, sharp and judging. When they told stories of beasts and curses, I no longer repeated the warnings with my peers. Instead, I listened ,  every word a chain, every glance a reminder that the world outside our fields was forbidden. I would nod, silent and obedient in appearance, yet my thoughts traveled freely.

I remember one afternoon in early autumn. Elder Maen had summoned the children to the circle of stones near the river, where the moss grew thick and the earth smelled of damp decay. He lifted his staff and spoke in a voice that trembled only slightly ,  enough for those attuned to notice.

“Dragons once roamed freely,” he said, and the children shivered. “They are cunning, proud, and terrible. Their eyes pierce the soul. One look is enough to curse the unwary. One touch is enough to bring fire to the living.”

The younger children pressed close to their mothers. A few older boys whispered to each other, testing the limits of belief. I stayed at the back, knees drawn up, hands pressed to my lap. I felt a chill, not from fear of him, but from the truth of my own curiosity. My mind traced the lines of the forest beyond the circle, imagining shapes that were forbidden.

I had begun to notice other signs ,  subtle, almost imperceptible. Tracks in the mud along the river, enormous and clawed; a tremor in the earth that could not have been caused by human or animal; the occasional crack of wood or stone that seemed too deliberate, too heavy. I told myself it was my imagination. But even as I said it, I felt the pull, deep in my chest, urging me to follow.

One evening, as the sun sank behind the mountains, painting the sky in shades of blood and gold, I slipped from the village under cover of dusk. The forest welcomed me in the way only forbidden places can: with quiet anticipation, with the smell of wet leaves and earth, with the subtle hum of life that did not belong to the village. My heart thudded against my ribs like a warning drum, but I ignored it.

I followed a narrow deer trail up the ridge, past the river bend, past the trees that the elders said were haunted. My pulse raced, not with fear, but with a desperate, frantic anticipation. Every snap of a twig, every rustle of leaves, sent me freezing in place. Yet I could not turn back. Something in the dark, beyond the known, called to me with a voice I could not hear but felt in every bone.

It was then I saw the first signs. Not tracks, not prints ,  something larger, deeper, something alive. A shadow passed through the moonlight, vast and sinuous, moving with a grace that seemed impossible. My breath caught. My hands went to my mouth. For a heartbeat, I thought I had imagined it. But the ground quivered beneath my feet, faintly, a rolling vibration that resonated through the soles of my shoes and straight into my chest.

I crouched behind a moss-covered boulder, heart hammering. I wanted to run. Every instinct screamed to flee. And yet, I could not. My legs were rooted. My eyes refused to blink. The pull was stronger than fear.

I did not see it fully that night. Only glimpses ,  the glint of scales in the moonlight, the curve of something impossibly long and powerful. And then it was gone, slipping into shadow as if it had never been there at all.

I spent the next days in a haze of anticipation and guilt. I could not speak of it, not even to myself, without trembling. I walked through the village streets, every glance from the elders a reminder of my own obedience, every whispered word of caution from neighbors pressing like stones against my chest. And yet, beneath the fear, something had shifted. Curiosity was no longer a whisper. It had grown into a low, constant hum that vibrated through my bones.

I began to think of the dragons not as monsters, but as beings I had not yet learned to understand. The tales of old, of fire and destruction, seemed suddenly inadequate. I had seen a shadow of something magnificent, and I could not unsee it. I could not forget the pull I felt in the forest, the way the earth seemed to hum under its passing, the way the air vibrated with life that was not human.

One night, I dared a step further. I left the village as the moon rose, high and pale, and crept into the forest with only the sound of my breathing and the occasional rustle of leaves for company. The trees closed around me, black and towering, and I felt both fear and wonder prickling every nerve.

And then I heard it.

A low, resonant vibration, like distant thunder but steady, deliberate. I froze, heart thundering. The sound traveled through the ground, through the roots, through my own body. I felt it in my chest, in my stomach, in the tips of my fingers. My mind screamed: *Run! Run! Run!*

But my body did not obey.

I moved forward, step by careful step, until I came to a small clearing bathed in moonlight. And there ,  only for a moment, before it disappeared into shadow ,  I saw it again.

A curve of scales, glinting silver in the moonlight. A massive tail sweeping across the earth, tipped with sharp, ridged plates. The air vibrated as it passed. My breath caught in my throat. My legs shook. I was terrified beyond measure ,  yet utterly enraptured.

I stumbled backward, pressed against a tree, and whispered to myself, *You are imagining this. It does not exist. It cannot exist.*

And yet I knew better.

That night, I lay beneath my quilt, trembling, my mind replaying the vision over and over. I traced the curve of the tail, the ripple of scales, the faint shimmer of movement through the shadows. I chastised myself for thinking it, for hoping it. And yet, in my chest, a spark had ignited ,  one that fear could not extinguish.

Over the following weeks, I found myself walking closer to the forest with each nightfall. I traced the river bend further, followed animal tracks into dense underbrush, and listened to the subtle changes in the wind, the rustle of leaves, the faint tremors beneath the earth. Every step was a dance with fear. Every glance over my shoulder reminded me of the village, the elders, the warnings passed down for generations.

And yet, I could not stop.

I began to understand the truth about fear. It was not just a tool for survival. It was a cage. The elders had built it carefully, hammered it into the hearts of the children so we would not question, so we would not wander, so we would not see the world beyond the firelight. But I had glimpsed it ,  just a shadow of the world beyond their rules ,  and I could not return to ignorance.

One evening, as the sun bled behind the mountains and the forest floor glowed gold, I saw another sign. A tree, enormous and ancient, had been clawed. Deep grooves carved into the bark, as if something massive had pressed against it with deliberate force. My hands tingled when I touched the grooves. I could feel the life beneath the surface, the power that had made them. And a whisper of understanding passed through me: *It is real. It is alive. And it knows you.*

I fled the forest that night, heart hammering, lungs aching, mind alight with terror and longing. Every step toward the village felt like betrayal, yet every heartbeat whispered the truth I could not deny.

I was alone. I was terrified. I was an outcast in my own mind, torn between obedience and the hunger to know. Every glance from the villagers, every whispered word of caution, every shadow in the firelight reminded me of what I could lose. Yet I could not stop. The pull had become irresistible.

It was then, in the thick of that fear and anticipation, that I first felt the connection. The quiet tremor in the earth. The whisper in the wind. The heartbeat of something vast and ancient, moving just beyond the edge of my perception.

And I knew, with the certainty that comes from seeing a truth no one else could, that my life would never be the same.

The dragon existed. And one day, it would find me.


### **Flight of the Emberheart **

The dragon waited for me at the edge of the cliff, its body outlined in firelight against a bruised evening sky. The wind from the canyon smelled of rain and smoke ,  the scent of something wild, something ancient. I wanted to run. My hands trembled, and my heart was so loud in my chest I was sure it could hear.

But the dragon didn’t move. It just watched me. One enormous eye, golden and bright as molten metal, fixed on me with a stillness that felt both alien and intelligent. I took a hesitant step closer. Its scales shifted with the light, a mosaic of bronze and deep green, like sunlight filtered through leaves.

I told myself not to touch it.
And then I did.

The scale beneath my palm was hotter than I expected ,  dry, rough-edged, but alive. It flexed under my hand, the hide stretching slightly as the dragon breathed. I could feel the slow rhythm of its body ,  the rise and fall, the weight of air moving through lungs the size of chambers. My throat went dry.

When it lowered itself, I froze. The ground trembled beneath its weight. It was an invitation, I realized ,  or a challenge. My knees nearly buckled as I climbed up, fingers slipping between the ridges along its spine. Every motion of its body was power restrained; I could feel the tension in the muscles beneath me, as if the whole creature was one breath away from motion.

The dragon exhaled ,  a deep, rolling sound that rattled my ribs. Then it crouched.

I barely managed to grab hold before it leapt.

The world vanished. Wind slammed into me so hard I couldn’t breathe. My stomach lurched ,  a dizzy, sickening drop ,  and then the dragon’s wings caught the air with a thunderous crack. I was weightless, then pressed against its back as we climbed. The ground dropped away until it was nothing but blur and shadow.

The air grew colder. My eyes watered, my hair whipped across my face, but beneath the terror was something else ,  a rising thrill that burned through the fear. The dragon’s body radiated heat, and I could feel every movement, every ripple of muscle as it powered upward. I pressed my hands against its neck, felt the roughness of the scales and the pulse beneath. Its heartbeat was slow and sure ,  a steady drum that drowned out my panic.

We broke through the clouds, and I gasped. The world below disappeared into white. Above us, the sky was endless ,  a pale, golden blue that made my chest ache. The dragon’s wings stretched wide, glowing at the edges where sunlight caught the translucent webbing.

I leaned forward, breath catching in my throat. The scales were smoother here, warm and damp with mist. My fear began to loosen its grip, replaced by something that felt almost like reverence.

And then the dragon turned its head ,  just slightly ,  and our eyes met.

It wasn’t human. But there was understanding there, something patient and impossibly old. The gaze pierced straight through me, and I felt small ,  not insignificant, but *seen.* My fear evaporated in that instant, burned away by wonder.

The dragon tilted its wings and we dove.

I screamed ,  not in terror this time, but exhilaration. The air tore past, cold and sharp, the world spinning in a blur of light and cloud. I clung to its neck, laughter bursting out between gasps. My heart was racing so fast it hurt, but I didn’t care. For the first time in my life, I wasn’t trapped by gravity, by fear, by anything.

The dragon pulled out of the dive effortlessly, gliding over a sea of clouds that glowed orange in the fading sun. The wind softened. My body trembled from the cold, but the dragon’s warmth seeped into me, steady and grounding.

I let go of the ridges and spread my arms. The air rushed past my fingertips, alive and electric. I felt like part of the sky ,  small, weightless, infinite.

I leaned forward and pressed my palm to the dragon’s neck again. It rumbled ,  a sound I could feel in my bones, low and content. I closed my eyes.

“This isn’t what I thought you’d be,” I whispered.

Another rumble ,  almost a reply. I could feel its calm, its certainty, its ancient patience. Somehow, I knew it wasn’t carrying me out of kindness, or ownership. It was sharing something. Letting me borrow its sky for a moment.

When we finally descended, I didn’t want to land. The air thickened, the clouds fell away, and the cliffs rose to meet us. The dragon touched down with impossible grace, talons cutting into stone. My legs were trembling when I slid off its back, the world still swaying beneath me.

It lowered its head, bringing that golden eye level with mine again. I hesitated ,  then reached out, laying my hand against its snout.

“Thank you,” I breathed. My voice shook.

The dragon exhaled, a warm gust washing over me, smelling of smoke and rain. Then it turned away, muscles rolling like waves beneath its scales, and with a single motion it launched itself into the air ,  wings spreading wide, catching the last light of sunset.

I watched until it disappeared into the clouds. The echo of its roar lingered in the air, deep and distant, like the memory of thunder.

I stood there long after, my skin still tingling, the smell of fire still clinging to my clothes ,  and I realized I’d left a part of myself in the sky.




### **Emberheart at Night**

The valley was silent when I returned.
Moonlight pooled between the cliffs, cold and silver, washing the stone in a dreamlike glow. The wind had stilled; even the trees below seemed to hold their breath.

I told myself I’d only come to look.
To prove that it had been real ,  that the flight, the fire, the impossible warmth beneath my hands weren’t something I’d imagined.
But as soon as I reached the edge of the cliff, I felt it.

A pulse.
Not sound ,  *feeling.*
Somewhere deep in the dark, something vast was awake.

My heart began to race again, but not from fear. The air felt charged, alive with a kind of quiet power that made every hair on my skin rise. I took a step forward, peering into the shadowed ravine below.

And then I saw it.

Two golden eyes opened in the dark.

For a moment, I couldn’t breathe. The dragon was lying across the stone, wings folded close, its scales dull in the moonlight ,  no longer fire and bronze, but soft shades of pewter and deep shadow. Even at rest, it looked like a living piece of the mountain.

When it lifted its head, the movement was slow, deliberate.
I half expected it to roar, to drive me back ,  but instead, it just looked at me.
The same calm, ancient gaze that had followed me through the clouds.

I stepped closer, every part of me trembling.
“I didn’t think you’d be here,” I whispered.

The dragon’s breath rolled out ,  warm, slow, misting in the cold air. The sound wasn’t threatening. It was… curious. Like it was listening.

The ground vibrated softly as I moved closer. The smell of smoke and rain returned ,  the scent that had clung to my clothes after our flight. I reached out, hesitating only for a heartbeat, and touched its neck again.

The skin felt cooler this time, the scales faintly damp from night air. Beneath them, I could feel the faint hum of life ,  that same deep pulse I’d felt before. The dragon didn’t move away. Instead, it exhaled through its nostrils, and the warmth rolled over me like a sigh.

Something inside me loosened. The fear that had lived in my chest since I first saw it ,  that sharp edge of awe and terror ,  melted away.

Without really thinking, I whispered, “Do you remember me?”

The dragon blinked slowly. A low sound vibrated through the air ,  not quite a growl, not quite a hum. The stone beneath my boots seemed to echo it. I felt it in my spine, my chest, my bones. It wasn’t language, but it was *understanding.*

I closed my eyes. For a heartbeat, it was like I could *feel* what it felt ,  the stillness of the night, the weight of the air, the slow rhythm of existence. There was no fear in it, no loneliness. Just presence.

When I opened my eyes again, the dragon was watching me with something softer than curiosity ,  recognition.

I moved closer, until I was standing beneath its head. Its breath was warm on my skin. I could see the faint scars along its jaw, the small imperfections that made it real. I lifted a hand and laid it against its cheek.

Its skin was rough, like cool stone, but beneath that ,  a heartbeat.

“I was afraid of you,” I said softly. “And now I can’t stop thinking about you.”

The dragon’s eye closed halfway, a slow, deliberate blink. Its chest rose and fell once ,  an exhale that brushed my hair back from my face.

Then, as if the night itself had been waiting for that moment, it moved. Slowly, carefully, the dragon lowered its massive head until its snout rested against the stone beside me. The vibration that came from its chest was low, steady ,  not a purr, not quite a growl, but something in between.

I sank down beside it, leaning my back against the warm scales. The air around us smelled faintly of smoke and rain, of life older than memory. The heat from its body seeped into me, and for the first time in months ,  maybe years ,  I felt safe.

We stayed like that for a long time. The stars wheeled above us, cold and bright. The dragon’s breathing slowed; my own breath followed it, syncing unconsciously.

I didn’t speak again. There were no words big enough for the quiet between us.

When I finally began to drift toward sleep, I felt something ,  faint, like a whisper beneath thought. A feeling more than a voice: ***You belong to the sky now.***

I didn’t know if it came from the dragon or from somewhere inside myself. But I smiled anyway.

When dawn came, I woke to find the dragon gone. Only a faint shimmer of heat lingered on the stone where it had lain. But I didn’t feel empty. I felt *known.*

And I knew I’d see it again.



### **The Whisper and the Wound**

I haven’t told anyone.
Not about the flight.
Not about the night.

Every time I think of speaking, the words die somewhere between my throat and my heartbeat.

The village is full of stories about dragons. Every child grows up with them ,  whispered warnings over the fire, carved into totems, painted on the old stones near the well. *Never look a dragon in the eye. Never follow its call. Never touch its shadow.*

They call them *curse-bearers.* *Sky-devils.* Some say they burn whole valleys when angered; others say they steal souls, carrying them away into the clouds, leaving bodies behind like husks. The elders claim a dragon’s gaze can rot crops, sour milk, make a woman barren.

I used to believe them.
I think part of me still does.

When I walk through the market now, I feel eyes on me. Maybe I imagine it ,  but the glances linger. The blacksmith’s wife whispers something when I pass; two children stop their play to stare. Maybe they notice the smell ,  faint smoke in my hair, no matter how often I wash it. Maybe they notice the burn on my wrist, the one I got when my hand brushed its breath too closely.

I told them it was from the forge. They nodded, but their eyes said *liar.*

At night, when I lie awake, the questions come.
*What if they’re right? What if it marked me?*

The thought turns over and over, restless and cold. What if the warmth I felt wasn’t trust but ownership? What if I’m no longer entirely my own?

And yet ,  when I close my eyes, I feel it again: the wind, the heat, the weightless drop through the clouds. The pulse of its heart through my palms. The quiet rumble that wasn’t a growl but something gentler, something like… affection.

That memory undoes me.

Fear and longing twist together until I can’t tell them apart. Every breath feels stolen. Every heartbeat feels too loud. I wake before dawn sometimes, certain I’ve heard wings in the distance ,  a deep, rolling sound that fades before I can be sure it was real.

I know what would happen if the elders found out.
They’d drive me out.
Or worse ,  they’d hunt it.

The tribe’s warriors carry old spears tipped with iron said to pierce dragonhide. They keep them locked in the shrine, polished and waiting, though no one has seen a dragon for generations. They’d see my silence as betrayal, my awe as heresy.

And maybe it is.

Because I can’t stop thinking about the next time.
The thought terrifies me. It thrills me.

Sometimes I dream that I’m standing on that cliff again, waiting ,  wind curling around my fingers, heart pounding like it did before the first leap. I can almost feel the vibration of its wings in the air, the soft thunder rolling closer.

Then I wake up, drenched in sweat, whispering its name. *Emberheart.*
The name I gave it. The name I never said aloud.

If the others knew, they’d call me cursed.
But the truth is simpler ,  and far worse.

I’m not cursed. I’m *called.*

And every day I resist that call, it feels a little more like trying to hold back the tide with my bare hands.




### **The Fire and the Story**

I remember the night the elders spoke of dragons.
It was midsummer ,  the air thick with pine smoke and laughter, the river murmuring just beyond the fields. We’d built a bonfire so tall it swallowed the stars. Sparks rose like small, frantic souls, and the drums of the dancers echoed against the dark hills.

All of us children sat close to the flames, knees drawn up, faces orange and flickering. The heat was fierce enough to sting, but none of us moved. We were waiting for the stories.

Elder Maen was the first to speak. His voice was rough from age and smoke, but when he told stories, the fire seemed to listen.
He leaned on his staff and said, *“A dragon’s breath can boil a river dry. Its shadow withers crops. Once, long ago, one came down from the mountain and carried off a child who dared to climb too high.”*

The other elders nodded, their faces hard and solemn in the firelight. One woman added, *“They don’t kill for hunger. They kill for pride. Their hearts burn too bright ,  and anything that burns that bright leaves nothing behind.”*

The children gasped, pressed close together. I remember the smell of roasted grain, the taste of honey on my lips, the sharp smoke in my throat. I wanted to believe them. I *did* believe them.

But I also remember what I saw when Elder Maen lifted his hand toward the fire ,  how the flames leapt higher, painting his face red and terrible. For a heartbeat, he looked less like a man and more like the monster he described.

And something in me whispered: *If dragons are born of fire… why does this feel the same?*

That thought frightened me more than the story itself. I pushed it down, hard, and laughed when the other children laughed. We threw twigs into the flames, pretending to burn the dragons away.

Later that night, when the crowd thinned and the drums faded, I stayed behind. The embers crackled quietly, glowing like sleeping eyes. The elders’ words still hung in the air ,  heavy, final.

I remember thinking that fear had a smell. It was sharp, like smoke that never quite clears.

Now, when I think back on that night, I realize something I couldn’t then:
I didn’t fear dragons because I *knew* them.
I feared them because everyone else did.

The stories had been carved into us like marks in wood ,  passed down so long that no one remembered why. We inherited terror like a family name. And I’d carried it for years, never once questioning if it was earned.

Until the day I touched a dragon’s skin and found warmth instead of death.

I wonder how many of the elders ever saw one with their own eyes. How many of their stories were stitched together from echoes and ash.

Sometimes I imagine sitting with them again, around that same fire. I’d listen to their warnings, their certainty, and then I’d tell my own story ,  of flight and wind and the heartbeat of something older than fear.

I don’t know if they’d believe me.
But at least, for once, the fire would burn for truth instead of dread.



 
### **The Return to the Fire**

It had been three summers since I’d sat by the village fire.

The night air smelled the same ,  pine sap, dry grass, the faint sweetness of river reeds ,  but it no longer felt like home. The path down from the ridge was overgrown now, the roots thicker, the soil unfamiliar beneath my feet. When the first embers came into view, rising like fireflies into the dusk, my chest tightened with something I couldn’t name.

I stopped just before the light touched me. For a moment I almost turned back.

Laughter carried across the clearing ,  children’s voices, high and untroubled. The sound hit me like a memory. I could see myself there again, smaller, sitting cross-legged with sticky fingers from roasted fruit, waiting for the stories. Waiting to be told what to fear.

Now I stood at the edge of the firelight, cloak drawn close, the smell of smoke threading through the fabric. A few faces turned toward me ,  recognition flickering, then uncertainty. The elders whispered to one another.

“Is that her?” I heard someone murmur.
“She came back.”
“After all this time?”

I stepped forward anyway. The crowd shifted, parting just enough for me to approach the fire. Its warmth hit me in waves, alive and restless.

Elder Maen was still there ,  older, thinner, his hair gone entirely white. He leaned on his staff and looked at me for a long, unreadable moment. The silence stretched. The drums had stopped. Even the children had gone quiet.

“You’ve been to the mountain,” he said finally. Not a question.

I swallowed. My throat was dry. “Yes.”

A low murmur ran through the circle. Someone hissed something I couldn’t catch ,  a prayer, maybe, or a curse.

Maen’s eyes flickered like coals in the firelight. “We told you long ago what dwells there. Why would you go?”

I wanted to tell him the truth ,  that I hadn’t gone looking for a dragon, that the dragon had found me, that it had changed everything I thought I knew about the world. But the words caught behind my teeth. Around me, faces glowed orange with suspicion.

“I needed to see,” I said softly. “I needed to know if the stories were true.”

The elder’s mouth tightened. “And were they?”

I hesitated. The fire cracked sharply. Shadows leapt across his face.

“No,” I said. “Not the way you told them.”

A sharp intake of breath rippled through the crowd. Someone spat into the dirt. A child began to cry.

Maen’s hand clenched around his staff. “You bring danger by speaking so.”

I could feel their fear thickening, as real as the smoke curling around us. The smell of it burned my throat ,  old fear, inherited fear, the same kind that once lived in me.

“I bring only truth,” I said, my voice shaking but clear. “You taught us to fear what we never met. But I met one. I touched it. It didn’t kill me. It carried me through the clouds. It, ”

“Enough!” Maen’s voice cut through the night like a blade. The fire flared, bright and wild. “You’ve been marked. You carry its taint.”

Gasps. The word *taint* struck harder than any blow. The crowd drew back, as if heat rolled off me instead of the fire.

For a moment, I almost believed them. I could feel the dragon’s warmth still in my skin, the faint scent of smoke that never left my hair. Maybe that was what they saw ,  something touched by the sky.

But before I could speak again, the wind changed.

It came suddenly ,  a low, rising hum that trembled through the ground. The fire guttered, then bent eastward, toward the dark horizon. The villagers turned, murmuring, eyes wide.

I knew that sound before they did. The heavy, rhythmic thunder that wasn’t thunder at all.

Wings.

I felt it before I saw it ,  that pulse, that vibration that lived somewhere between sound and heartbeat. The firelight flickered across faces drained of color. Someone screamed.

And then the clouds tore apart.

A shape emerged, vast and gleaming, scales catching the moonlight like molten glass. The dragon’s cry rolled through the valley ,  not a roar of rage, but something deeper, mournful, echoing.

The villagers scattered, shoving children toward the huts. Elder Maen stood frozen, the firelight trembling in his eyes.

And I ,  I couldn’t move. My fear was there, yes, but so was something else. Recognition.

It had come back for me.

The dragon circled once, enormous wings stirring the dust and embers into spirals. The fire flared brighter, casting gold across its underside. For a moment, the whole clearing glowed ,  every face lit by the same impossible light.

I felt tears sting my eyes. Around me, the people shouted prayers, curses, pleas. But all I heard was my own heartbeat, loud and steady, syncing with the rhythm in the sky.

I stepped forward.

Maen’s voice broke, “Girl, no, !”

But I was already walking toward the edge of the firelight, where shadow met flame, and the wind of its wings reached me ,  warm, familiar, wild.

My heart was splitting open with fear and longing, and I didn’t know which one would win.
